Comments:
- Good to see you tried unit testing. Unfortunately, these tests
  are flaky and won't solve the problem. But I am happy you
  tried.
- Work towards your presentation skills.
- I am not a fan of organizing my code this way, but I would
  like you to be more careful on how to organize stuff.
