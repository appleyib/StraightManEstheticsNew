We plan to design a social network application to provide a platform for people who desire to public their ideas anonymously and discuss the ideas with other users. The purpose of this application is provide a chance to public some dissimliar thoughts without facing the risk of continuous attack from other users. Also we think it’s gone be fun to discuss with ‘strangers’ (however,  some of them may be your friends). Our main target users is the morden youngers who prefer to communicate with others through texts rather than face-to-face or telephone also the people who would like to try some new social networks. Users still cansee their friends’ unanonymous posts, but users will never know what their friends will say when they hide their name.


Our main data will be user profile and posts, since the relationship between the data is simple we decide to use MongoDB to load/save the data of the application. Here is the summary of the features:
